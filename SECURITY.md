# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Zephyrus Foundation, we take the security of our systems seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, please help us responsibly disclose the issue.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities directly to us via the following email:

**security@zephyrusfoundation.org**

Your report should include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any potential impacts or consequences.
- If possible, a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Please **DO NOT** create public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities, as this could expose the vulnerability to others before it is fixed.

### Response Time

- We aim to acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours.
- A fix will be prioritized and released as soon as possible, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
- We will keep you updated on the status of the issue and notify you when it is resolved.

### Scope

This security policy covers the following repositories:
- All repositories within the [Zephyrus Foundation GitHub organization](https://github.com/ZephyrusFoundation).

### General Guidelines

- If you are unsure whether an issue is security-related, err on the side of caution and report it via the security email.
- We ask that you give us reasonable time to fix any vulnerabilities before publicly disclosing the issue.
- We encourage you to check for and report any third-party libraries or dependencies that may also be vulnerable.

## Security Updates

We recommend that users regularly update their versions of our software to the latest stable releases, as these often include important security updates.

## Thanks

We appreciate the effort of all contributors and security researchers who take the time to help keep our projects safe.
